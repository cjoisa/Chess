This Chess Game makes use of the Standard chess notation to move pieces.
To perform any move the following guildlines must be followed :
The pieces are identified by their initials. These are K (King),
Q (Queen), R (Rook), B (Bishop), and N (Knight).
For example, Qg5 means "queen moves to the g-file and the 5th rank"
(that is, to the square g5). 
To resolve ambiguities, one more letter or number is added to indicate
the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. Ngf3 means "knight 
from the g-file moves to the square f3", and R1e2 means "rook on the 
first rank moves to e2". The letter P for a pawn is not used, so that
e4 means "pawn moves to the square e4".
If the piece makes a capture, "x" is inserted before the destination
square. Thus Bxf3 means "bishop captures on f3". When a pawn makes a
capture, the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a 
piece initial. For example, exd5 (pawn on the e-file captures the 
piece on d5).
Castling is indicated by the special notations 0-0 for kingside castling
and 0-0-0 for queenside castling.
